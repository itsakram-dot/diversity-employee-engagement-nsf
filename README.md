# Diversity & Employee Engagement Analysis at the National Science Foundation

### Overview
This project investigates how **employee recognition**, **agile practices**, and **diversity measures** affect employee engagement within the **National Science Foundation** (NSF). Using statistical analysis and data exploration, we evaluated hypotheses related to recognition, agile methods, and their impact on DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility).

### Files in this Repository
- **annotated-Group-Project-Group-10.pdf**  
  A detailed PDF report outlining our methodology, regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and final recommendations.
- **Group Project Group 10.qmd**  
  The Quarto (or RMarkdown) source file containing the code, data transformations, and visualizations used in our analysis.

### Key Insights
1. **Recognition & DEIA**  
   - Higher employee recognition correlates strongly with increased diversity, indicating inclusive workplace practices may reinforce each other.
2. **Agile Practices & Employee Engagement**  
   - Implementation of agile methods showed a positive relationship with both employee engagement and diversity metrics.
3. **Recommendations**  
   - **Age Sensitivity:** Tailor new processes for employees of all ages.  
   - **Recognition in Agile Environments:** Ensure smaller tasks from agile sprints still receive recognition.  
   - **Diverse Teams â†’ Greater Engagement:** Encouraging collaboration across diverse groups boosts overall engagement levels.

### Methodology
- **Data Source:** Filtered OPM data focusing on NSF employees.
- **Tools & Techniques:**  
  - Regression Analysis  
  - Descriptive Statistics  
  - Quarto/R Markdown for writing code chunks and generating final output  
- **Variables:** Measured **Recognition**, **Agile Practices**, **Diversity** (via Race & Sex categories), **Employee Engagement**.
